# PHP PR Review Guidelines

## Introduction
Welcome to the PHP PR review process! To maintain code quality and consistency, please adhere to the following guidelines when submitting a pull request.

## Code Style
1. **PSR Standards**: Use PSR-2 coding standard.
2. **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces for indentation.
3. **Naming Conventions**: Use camelCase for variables and functions, and PascalCase for classes. Follow a consistent naming pattern throughout the codebase.

## PHP Best Practices
1. **Type Declarations**: Leverage PHP 7 type declarations for parameters and return types.
2. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling using try-catch blocks and avoid using `@` for error suppression.
3. **Namespacing**: Organize your code into meaningful namespaces to avoid naming conflicts.
4. **Use Composer**: Manage dependencies using Composer. Ensure that the `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files are updated.

## Documentation
1. **PHPDoc Comments**: Include PHPDoc comments to document functions, classes, and significant blocks of code.
2. **README Updates**: If your changes introduce new features or modify existing ones, update the project's README with relevant information.

## Testing
1. **Unit Tests**: Include PHPUnit tests for your changes. Ensure that existing tests pass.
2. **Integration Tests**: If applicable, add integration tests to cover the integration of your changes with other parts of the system.

## Code Review Process
1. **Small, Atomic Commits**: Keep your commits small and focused on a single task or feature.
2. **Clear Commit Messages**: Write clear and descriptive commit messages following a conventional style.
3. **Respond to Comments Promptly**: Address comments from reviewers promptly and make necessary changes.
4. **Rebase Before Merge**: Keep your feature branch up to date and rebase it on the latest main branch before merging.

## Security
1. **Input Validation**: Validate user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
2. **Secure Dependencies**: Regularly check for and update dependencies to avoid known security vulnerabilities.
